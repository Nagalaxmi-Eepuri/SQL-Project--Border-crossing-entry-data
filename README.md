# Border Crossing Analysis_MySQL_POWERBI

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. border crossing data, focusing on vehicle and pedestrian movements across the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico borders. Using MySQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization, the analysis uncovers key trends and insights related to border traffic.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of historical records of border crossings, including details such as:
- Border (U.S.-Canada or U.S.-Mexico)
- Measure Type (e.g., trucks, pedestrians, buses, personal vehicles)
- Port Name
- Crossing Date
- State
- Value: Number of Crossings.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and structured query analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and reporting.

## Key Insights & Analysis
1. **Total Crossings Per Year & Border**
   - Identifies annual trends in crossings for both U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico borders.

Used KPIs to show Toal Crossings and Average Crossings.
Added Slicers to filter the data.

## SQL Queries Used
- Aggregations for total crossings per year.
- Monthly trend analysis using date functions.
- State-wise analysis of common crossing types.

## Power BI Visualizations
- **Stacked Column Charts**: Yearly trends in crossings and Common measure type by state.
- **Line Charts**: Monthly comparisons for Trucks and Pedestrian crossings.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into border traffic patterns.
